## API

### `joyful(options?)`

| Option      | Type     | Default | Description                           |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `segments`  | `number` | `2`     | Number of words to generate           |
| `separator` | `string` | `"-"`   | Character(s) between words            |
| `maxLength` | `number` | —       | Maximum length of the returned string |

Returns a `string` of random words joined by the separator.

When `maxLength` is set, words are filtered to fit within the constraint. Throws if the limit is too short to produce a valid result.

## SFW Guarantee
